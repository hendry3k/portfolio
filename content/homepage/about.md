# Self Introduction

Welcome to my personal website. I'm a software engineer who is studying computer system Engineering at Tshwane University of Technology. Over the past 3 years I helped businesses to build their software, help them to reach millions of customers online. I have attendant many hackathons, I enjoy working with a team to build software that solves human problems. I met amazing software developers through hackathons and I believe when technology used right, it can reduce most of our problems, such as disease and poverty.
