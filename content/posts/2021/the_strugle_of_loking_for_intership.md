<!--more-->

ago maybe I would have got one by one now... Thank you corona. Now usually a
semester last for 6 months 6 months, but beacuse classes was prospned during
lockdiown that made my last semester to last for 12 months on top of that the
university made us to write an exam. Likely I pass.

The oficial marks came out on the 19 of December 2020, and I started to be
intersively looking for intership the first week of january and oOh boy
I have already been overwelemed with rejection and no replies. I knew this was
not going t be easy but I never thought it will be this hard. Sometine I even
blane the system for requiring us to work on the field before we graduate without
providing a field to work on.

Due to rejectin I have change my cv more than 3 times in one month. I do not
know what is right anymore. I am asking the tech community or any one to assit
me finding mistakes on my cv and portfolio, and suggestion on how I can Improve
my cv and portfolio. For the most part please share with me oppening where they
need a junir software engineer, intership or graduate programe
