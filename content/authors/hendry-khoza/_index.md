## Self Introduction

Welcome to my personal website. I'm a software engineer who is studying
computer system Engineering at Tshwane University of Technology. Over the past
3 years I helped businesses to build their software, help them to reach
millions of customers online. I have attendant many hackathons, I enjoy working
with a team to build software that solves human problems. I met amazing
software developers through hackathons and I believe when technology used
right, it can reduce most of our problems, such as disease and poverty.
