When I say I am a Software Engineer is more than a job title. What I do matters
I do not just write code, I build software that changes people's lives and that
is a huge responsibility. If you think for a minute about the peoples who use
the software I build... They put trust in me.

When I was at university I excel
academically, especially in technical programming. after school, I continue to
take online classes on the topic such as data structure and system design to
improve my skills. I am dedicated to learning more when given a chance.
Quality of software is the heart of every line of code that I write. I always
write software that: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item works - The program does the task that is design to do
  \item can be modified - I make sure that my code is easy to read, understand or change
  \item reusable - I apply object-oriented design so that it will be easy to use part of the program to another program 
\end{itemize}

When I was at university I took multiple Udemy courses to supplement my school
with React, Express brings joy to me.
I am good at programming, I didn't limit myself to one programing language that 
was thought in my class which is c++,  I took extra time to learn multiple 
programming languages such as Python, Go, and typescript. Now I am in the process of
learning rust. I have a good grasp of working with modern tools such as Git and
cloud computing. My favorite tool is the bash scripting language because it
allows me to automate a lot of my work


I have been using Vodacom ever since my first phone and I really enjoy how
reliable it is even in rural areas. My favourite service from Vodacom was
Vodacom Millionaires. I used to play it every week,  every Vodacom customer
used to get two free entries to play.  I've won airtime multiple times from
Vodacom Millionaire.
I know that with the opportunity to fully invest myself in this career I would
be able to become a great software developer in your team.
