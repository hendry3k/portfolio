I am not gonna lie, sometimes I spent most of my time in a cellphone than I really wish to, then blame my selft for doing it because I know I shouldn't. Special when I am procrastinating about work that I really need to complete. A phone seems like a way of discration.

I unistall the [Twitter](www.twitter.com) app on my phone but then I always log in via the browser... All though thats a litle bit better since I don't get push notivation but is not perfet. Another app that I unistall Youtubes, Reddit to name a few

I also block push notofication to messages and and whatsapp but i will found myselft cheeking my phone even though nothing is happeni
