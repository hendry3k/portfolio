Welcome to my personal website. I'm a software engineer who is studying 
computer system Engineering at Thswane University of Technology. Over the past
3 years I have helped bussiness to build their software, help them to reach
millions of customers online. I have attendant many hackhons, I enjoy working
with a team to build software that solve human problems. I have met a amazing
software developers through hackhons and I believe when technology used right
it can reduce most of our problems, such as diesease and poverty.

## Portfolio, Including some projects I'm currently working on.
It has been proven multiple times in the tech industry that schools can not
teach you everything you need to know. Over these years I am at university
I spent some time learning other technologies and frameworks/libraries that
were not included in my syllabus. I've combined everything I learned from
school and outside school to build the following projects:

- **Radserve** A client website with modern design, built with [gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/),
- **Object detection** in security system using [openCV](https://opencv.org/)
- **Natour** A web application that let users book for holiday, build with [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **Food forkify** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) web application that let users search for food recipes

## Where I shine the most
Throughout high school, I've been a top achiever and
that didn't stop at university, I continue to work hard that I was even offered
a position to be a student assistant. I lean a lot at university  about
communication skills, teamwork including technical skills such as:

- **System Analysis** - I understand the five-phase of the development life
  cycle (SDLC) and an in-depth understanding of how information technology
  supports operational and business requirements in todayâ€™s competitive
  environment.

- **Operating Systems** - I have the skills needed when designing a modern
  operating system such as memory management, process management, schedule
  input/output including the in-depth knowledge of the LINUX operating system.

- **Database Principle** - I have knowledge of database and database management
  principles including the principle applied in the query language SQL and
  implementation of relational database.

- **Network System** - I am aware of various aspect and technologies involved
  in data communication and networking such as network topologies, contention
  protocol, data security
