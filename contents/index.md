## Who really is Hendry Khoza?

In a nutshell, Hendry Khoza is a [computer engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering) student at 
[Tshwane University of Technology](https://www.tut.ac.za/). One of the reason that made me choose 
this field of study is the opportunities that technology present to us to 
improve our daily lives. For instance, I recently switched to using [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
and I managed to automate some repetitive task on my work-flow and it made me
productive and encouraged me to contribute to [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source).


## Portfolio, Including some projects I'm currently working on.
It has been proven multiple times in the tech industry that schools can not
teach you everything you need to know. Over these years I am at university
I spent some time learning other technologies and frameworks/libraries that
were not included in my syllabus. I've combined everything I learned from
school and outside school to build the following projects:

- **Radserve** A client website with modern design, built with [gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/),
- **Object detection** in security system using [openCV](https://opencv.org/)
- **Natour** A web application that let users book for holiday, build with [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **Food forkify** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) web application that let users search for food recipes

## Where I shine the most
Throughout high school, I've been a top achiever and
that didn't stop at university, I continue to work hard that I was even offered
a position to be a student assistant. I lean a lot at university  about
communication skills, teamwork including technical skills such as:

- **System Analysis** - I understand the five-phase of the development life
  cycle (SDLC) and an in-depth understanding of how information technology
  supports operational and business requirements in todayâ€™s competitive
  environment.

- **Operating Systems** - I have the skills needed when designing a modern
  operating system such as memory management, process management, schedule
  input/output including the in-depth knowledge of the LINUX operating system.

- **Database Principle** - I have knowledge of database and database management
  principles including the principle applied in the query language SQL and
  implementation of relational database.

- **Network System** - I am aware of various aspect and technologies involved
  in data communication and networking such as network topologies, contention
  protocol, data security
