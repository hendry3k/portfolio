After a while I final finish building one project from the complete JavaScript 
course. I have to celebrate this to encourage myself to also finish the rest of
the projects I set myself to finish in the next 3 months. Since Jonas updated

grograming but still I needed to complete what I started and I don't think
javaScript is that bad as long used on the browse.

<window.scroll> event. If the user has scroll up to a desired X position we 
change the style of the nav bar to stick via CSS. It is possable to make a navbar
stick at the top of the screen with css so the best way is to toggle a class at
