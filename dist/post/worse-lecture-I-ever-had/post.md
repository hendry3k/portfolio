I think I speak for the most students when I say 2020  was a difficult year
accademically, It was even more than worse to us who have shitty lectures.
It is quite common in IT to find smart people being bad at just being
human being, from Linux stenford to Steve Job, They have inspired a generation 
that just like being mean for no reason. I was suppose to finish all my theory 
modules for my National Diploma in Computer System Engineering this semester 
but that seems like will no longer happen because of mean lectures

When the corona virus hit, it hit unversities extra hard because they have to
adopt to the way of teaching (online), which they hate so much, After months of 
trying some lectures evetually get a hang of teaching online but as always
the is gonna be that one lectures who will never try at all, because he can't 
bost his ego online. This lecture has spoken down of other lectures, is kinda
of a lecture to wish death on your parents and expect you to write a exam during
the day of their funeral and call you stupid if you fail. I wonder why the
university still keep someone like him because I am sure the are many complaint
that are made about him, but I heard he use to get 7 distinction when he was
still a student and it happen to be the same university he is teaching. If he is
so smart, I assume he will be teaching B-Tech student but then again, Most B-Tec
student are paying their school fees on their pocker they will never take this
type of lectures.

I happen to repeat his module,
