      In a nutshell, Hendry Khoza is a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering"
        >computer engineering</a
      >
      student at
      <a href="https://www.tut.ac.za/">Tshwane University of Technology</a>. One
      of the reason that made me choose this field of study is the opportunities
      that technology present to us to improve our daily lives. For instance, I
      recently switched to using <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and I
      managed to automate some repetitive task on my work-flow and it made me
      productive and encouraged me to contribute to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a>.

      It has been proven multiple times in the tech industry that schools can
      not teach you everything you need to know. Over these years I am at
      university I spent some time learning other technologies and
      frameworks/libraries that were not included in my syllabus. I’ve combined
      everything I learned from school and outside school to build the following
      projects:
