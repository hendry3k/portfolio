      <p class="ttext">
        Welcome to my personal website. I'm a software engineer who is studying
        computer system Engineering at
        <a href="https://www.tut.ac.za/"
          >Tshwane University of Technology</a
        >. Over the past 3 years I helped businesses to build their software,
        help them to reach millions of customers online. I have attendant many
        hackathons, I enjoy working with a team to build software that solves
        human problems. I met amazing software developers through
        hackathons and I believe when technology used right, it can reduce most
        of our problems, such as disease and poverty.

        I owe the skills that I have to the tech community online such as
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> and the
        instructors who took the time to make
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> courses, with that being said
        I have the following skills:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Web Development</strong> - I am comfortable working with
            javascript/Typescript and Node.js but my favorite language for web
            is <a href="https://reactjs.org/">Go</a>. I have experience with
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/">react library</a> and Redux
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Mobile Development</strong> - I participated in the

              >MTN App of the Year Awards</a
            >
            in September 2020 where I develop android applications using
            <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/">android studio</a>,
            java, and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">firebase</a>, this
            experience made me feel more comfortable contributing to open source
            android application
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Linux and scripting language</strong> - I have been using
            Linux on a desktop for 2 years and my favorite tool is the bash
            terminal. Using Linux made it easy when I started using cloud
            computing because I was familiar with most of the tools and bash
            scripting language
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>System Development</strong> - I am happy that I got to learn
            about System Development life cycle when I was at university and the
            software engineering module took it further were got to learn about
            agile development.

          <p>
            <strong>Database Management</strong> - I have experience with SQL
            query language using
            <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/">oracle database</a> and
