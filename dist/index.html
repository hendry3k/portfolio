      <h2 class="title">Who is Hendry Khoza?</h2>

      <p class="text">
        In a nutshell, Hendry Khoza is a computer engineering student at
        <a href="https://www.tut.ac.za/">Tshwane University of Techonology</a>.
        I chose this field of study because of the opportunities that technology
        presents to us and I believe when used right it can improve our lives
        for the better.

      <h2 class="title">Where I shine the most</h2>
      <p class="subtext"><em>Where I shine the most</em></p>
      <p class="text">
        I owe the skills that I have to the tech community online such as
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> and the
        instructors who took the time to make
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> courses, with that being said
        I have the following skills:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Web Development</strong> - I am comfortable working with
            javascript/Typescript and Node.js but my favorite language for web
            is <a href="https://reactjs.org/">Go</a>. I have experience with
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/">react library</a> and Redux
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Mobile Development</strong> - I participated in the
            <a href="https://www.appoftheyear.co.za/"
              >MTN App of the Year Awards</a
            >
            in September 2020 where I develop android applications using
            <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/">android studio</a>,
            java, and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">firebase</a>, this
            experience made me feel more comfortable contributing to open source
            android application
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Linux and scripting language</strong> - I have been using
            Linux on a desktop for 2 years and my favorite tool is the bash
            terminal. Using Linux made it easy when I started using cloud
            computing because I was familiar with most of the tools and bash
            scripting language
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>System Development</strong> - I am happy that I got to learn
            about System Development life cycle when I was at university and the
            software engineering module took it further were got to learn about
            agile development.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Database Management</strong> - I have experience with SQL
            query language using
            <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/">oracle database</a> and
            have an understanding of the relation database such as MangoDB
