<p>In a nutshell, Hendry Khoza is a computer engineering student at Tshwane University of Technology. The possibilities on what technology can achieve to improve our daily life is what attracted me to this field of study, for instance, I recently switched to using ubuntu and I’ve never felt so free about any particular software. Linux (in general ) has changed my workflow for the better and encourages me to contribute to open-source.</p>

<p>It has been proven multiple times in the tech industry that schools can not teach you everything you need to know. Over the years I was at university I spent some time learning other technologies and frameworks/libraries that were not inclded in my syllabus. I’ve combined everything I learned from school and outside the school to build the following projects,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radserve</strong> A client website with modern design built with gatsby JS,</li>
<li><strong>Object detection</strong> in security system</li>
<li><strong>Natour</strong> A web application that let users book for holiday, integrated with third party system such as stripe</li>
<li><strong>Food forkify</strong> Avanila javascript web application that let users search for food recipes</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout high school, I’ve been a top achiever and that didn’t stop at university, I continue to work hard that I was even offered a position to be a student assistant. I lean a lot at university about communication skills, teamwork including technical skills such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>System Analysis</strong> - I understand the five-phase of the development life cycle (SDLC) and an in-depth understanding of how information technology supports operational and business requirements in today’s competitive environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating Systems</strong> - I have the skills needed when designing a modern operating system such as memory management, process management, schedule input/output including the in-depth knowledge of the LINUX operating system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Database Principle</strong> - I have knowledge of database and database management principles including the principle applied in the query language SQL and implementation of relational database.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network System</strong> - I am aware of various aspect and technologies involved in data communication and networking such as network topologies, contention protocol, data security</p></li>
</ul>
